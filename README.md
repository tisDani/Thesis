# Thesis
Welcome!

In Main we have the game engine and the monte Carlo agent, and at the end there is the function where a game of Monte Carlo versus Random is played out and the data is exported in csv format in two different files: one with the trial moves done in the game and another with the vectors of Upper Confidence Bounds for all the children to be chosen from is each decision taken by the Monte Carlo agent. 

Then in Tables we provide a notebook which processes the csv files and outputs tables of the order of the moves and which patterns most often occurr in 2x2 Trades.

Finally there is a notebook called simulation runner which runs main N a chosen amount of times, which is used to gather data.
